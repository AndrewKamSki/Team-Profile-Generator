  ## Installation

  To install this project, download the files from my repository at https://github.com/AndrewKamSki/Team-Profile-Generator. From there you can load in the index.js file in your favorite IDE. Run an NPM install in the console to load in the correct packages, then run a node index.js to start the application and begin entering data!

  ## Usage
  A walkthrough using the application can be seen here: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1pNeKVInYZjYJB4tTRLnSyskN3UFg7IFI

  Once you run the 'node index.js' the system will prompt you for information about your team. Once you are finished keying in information (saying 'no' to adding more teammates), the application will display an index.html file in the dist/ folder.

  The application takes the users information, and uses classes to organize the information. The classes are kept in an array and given certain html based on the role the information is for which is all compiled into the html file that is created.
